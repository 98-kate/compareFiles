# compareFiles
made a small script to compare multiple files in MATLAB to make my life easier when grading. this is made for an intro to MATLAB course so it only compares basic things such as variable names, comments, and overall structure of the code.
dump all desired files into a folder > run script > dialog box pops up asking you to choose a folder > returns a percentage based on how similar the code within files are
