# compareFiles
made a small script to compare multiple files in MATLAB to make my life a little easier when grading. 


this is made for an intro to MATLAB course so it only compares basic things such as variable names, comments, and overall structure of the code.
grab all the .m files you want to compare, same them in a folder, run compareFiles and a dialog box will pop up asking you to select a folder & after selecting it will compare every script in said folder to eachother and generate percentages based on how similar file1 is to file2 for example.
